# HPC Service Catalog

The NJIT High Performance Computing (HPC) facility provides a wide range of services to support research, teaching, and computation across disciplines.  
This catalog outlines the core services available to students, faculty, and researchers.


## Cluster Computing
Built by Dell, our computing cluster **Wulver** provides over 197 compute nodes to support computationally intensive workloads across various academic and research domains.  
Users can run simulations, data processing, and large-scale modeling efficiently using Wulver’s distributed computing infrastructure.
