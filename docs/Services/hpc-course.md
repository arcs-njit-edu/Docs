# HPC Resources for Courses

## Introduction
Instructors can utilize High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources for academic courses. Whether faculty are planning a course that involves computationally intensive tasks or introducing students to parallel computing concepts, the HPC environment can offer valuable resources.

## Course Details
To request HPC resources for course, you need to fill out the form (the link to the form will be provided soon) and provide the following information. 

### Name of Course:
[Please provide the name of the course and a short description]

### Estimated Number of Students:
[Enter the estimated number of students for the course]

### Activities on HPC:
[Describe the specific activities that will involve the use of HPC resources. For example, simulations, data analysis, modeling, etc.]

### Software Needed:
[Specify the software required for the course. Check the list of software installed on Wulver in [Software](../Software/index.md#software-list). Include any specific versions or software not already available on the HPC cluster] 

!!! warning "Notice Period"

    A minimum of 30 days' notice is required for requesting specific software installations or substantial resource allocations.

## Utilizing HPC in a Course
HPC resources are good for the courses if they satisfy the following requirements.

* **Simulations and Modeling**:
Perform complex simulations and modeling exercises that require significant computational power.
* **Data Analysis**:
Conduct large-scale data analysis projects, exploring real-world datasets with efficiency.
* **Parallel Computing**:
Teach parallel computing concepts and applications by leveraging the cluster's parallel processing capabilities.
* **Optimization Problems**:
Solve optimization problems that benefit from parallel processing and distributed computing.
* **Scientific Research Projects**:
Enable students to work on scientific research projects that demand high-performance computing resources.

## HPC Introduction
The HPC Facilitator is available to provide an introduction to High-Performance Computing. This introduction can be conducted in person or online based on the preferences and requirements of the course. The session covers:

* Overview of HPC concepts
* Accessing and navigating the HPC cluster
* Basic job submission and monitoring
* Filesystems on HPC cluster
* Conclusion

By incorporating HPC resources into your course, you provide students with the opportunity to engage in hands-on, real-world applications of computational concepts. The HPC environment enhances the learning experience and prepares students for challenges in data-driven and computationally intensive fields. For specific requests or to schedule an HPC introduction session, please contact the [HPC Facilitator](contact.md).
