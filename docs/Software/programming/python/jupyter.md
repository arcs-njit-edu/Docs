# Jupyter Notebooks
The Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform. The notebook combines live code, equations, narrative text, and visualizations. In our cluster, we have JupyterLab which is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface. 

## Availability

!!! warning 
    
    Please note that JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook is not available as a module on Wulver, as users can build those packages via Conda. Please see [Conda Documentation](conda.md) for details. Jupyter Notebook can also be accessed on Wulver via [Open OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/). We will provide the instructions soon.

## Jupyter Notebook on Wulver
As mentioned above, users need to install Jupyter Notebook on the Conda Environment. Once the [Conda Environment](conda.md#activate-and-deactivate-conda-environment) is activated users can install Jupyter Notebook via `conda install -c conda-forge jupyter notebook` command. Here we provide a sample SLURM script on how to start Jupyter Notebook session on Wulver.
