# Lochness

This very heterogeneous cluster is a mix of manufacturers, components, and capacities as it was built up in incremental purchases spanning several years. 

!!! warning "Much of lochness will be incorporated into the new Wulver cluster 1Q 2024."

## Specifications:

df.loc['Total'] = df.iloc[:,[1,4,6] ].sum(numeric_only=True)
df.fillna("", inplace=True)
