# HPC Resources for Teaching & Coursework

## Introduction
Instructors can utilize High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources for academic courses. Whether faculty are planning a course that involves computationally intensive tasks or introducing students to parallel computing concepts, the HPC environment can offer valuable resources.

## Course Request
To request HPC resources for your course, submit the following information to

[HPC Course Request Form](https://nexus.njit.edu/highlander_nexus?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=cd6eaea13b97e210e914eb0864e45a7f){ .md-button }
<!--
1. **Name of Course:** Please provide the name of the course and a short description
2. **Is this one section of a larger course?**: Yes or No
3. **Estimated Number of Students:** Enter the estimated number of students for the course
4. **Activities on HPC:** Describe the specific activities that will involve the use of HPC resources. For example, simulations, data analysis, modeling, etc.
5. **Software Needed:** Specify the software required for the course. Check the list of software installed on Wulver in [Software](../Software/index.md#software-list). Include any specific versions or software not already available on the HPC cluster 
-->
!!! warning "Notice Period"

    A minimum of 30 days' notice is required for requesting specific software installations or substantial resource allocations.

## When to Use HPC in a Course
HPC resources are good for the courses if they satisfy the following requirements.

* **Simulations and Modeling**:
Perform complex simulations and modeling exercises that require significant computational power.
* **Data Analysis**:
Conduct large-scale data analysis projects, exploring real-world datasets with efficiency.
* **Parallel Computing**:
Teach parallel computing concepts and applications by leveraging the cluster's parallel processing capabilities.
* **Optimization Problems**:
Solve optimization problems that benefit from parallel processing and distributed computing.
* **Scientific Research Projects**:
Enable students to work on scientific research projects that demand high-performance computing resources.


## HPC Introduction for Courses

This webinar provides an introduction to High-Performance Computing for coursework. The session covers:

* Overview of HPC concepts
* Accessing and navigating the HPC cluster
* Explanation of available partitions
* Basic job submission and monitoring
* Filesystems on HPC cluster
* How to contact us

## HPC Open Office Hours

If students have any issues or questions regarding HPC resources for their courses, they can stop by to meet with our student consultants and ask any questions you have about using HPC resources. We have also added a virtual option in case students are unable to come to the office in person (See the Zoom link below). There's no need to create a ticket or register in advance; if follow-up is needed, the student consultants will open a ticket on your behalf, and you'll receive further instructions. 

- :material-calendar: **Every Monday and Wednesday**
