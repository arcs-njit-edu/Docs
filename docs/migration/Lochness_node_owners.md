# Lochness Node Owners Information

## Overview

As a node owner on the Lochness high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, we would like to provide you with important information regarding the upcoming migration to the new cluster, Wulver.

## Node Migration to Wulver

### Privately Owned Nodes

Most privately owned nodes on Lochness will be migrated to Wulver as part of the cluster upgrade. Owners of these nodes will be considered "condo investors" and will receive higher priority access on an equivalent amount of resources for a period of time to be determined. This ensures that your investment in HPC resources continues to be recognized and prioritized during the transition.

### Decommissioning of Out-of-Warranty Nodes

Nodes that are out of warranty and deemed too old to become part of Wulver's infrastructure will be decommissioned. We will contact owners of such nodes for further discussions and potential considerations.

## Node Exclusions from Wulver Migration

### Nodes with Consumer Grade GPUs

Nodes equipped with consumer-grade GPUs, such as Titan, RTX, etc., will not be migrated to Wulver. Instead, these nodes will be relocated to the GITC 4320 datacenter and will be individually managed by ARCS.

This decision is made to ensure the optimal performance and compatibility of the Wulver cluster while providing an alternative solution for nodes with specialized hardware configurations.

## Action Required

1. **Privately Owned Node Owners:** Await further communication regarding the migration process and priority access details.
2. **Owners of Out-of-Warranty Nodes:** Await further communication for discussions on potential considerations and decommissioning.
3. **Owners of Nodes with Consumer Grade GPUs:** Expect your nodes to be relocated to the GITC 4320 datacenter, managed individually by ARCS.

## Timeline

The migration timeline and the duration of higher priority access for condo investors will be communicated to you in advance.
