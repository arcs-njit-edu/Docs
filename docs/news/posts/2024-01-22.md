# Wulver Maintenance

!!! important "Wulver Monthly Maintenance" 


Beginning Feb 1, 2024, ARCS HPC will be instituting a monthly maintenance downtime on all HPC systems on the second Tuesday from 9AM - 9PM. Wulver and the associated GPFS storage will be taken out of service for maintenance, repairs, patches and upgrades. During the maintenance downtime, logins will be disabled, users will not have access to their stored data in `/project`, `/home` and `/scratch`. All jobs that do not end before 9AM will be held by the scheduler until the downtime is complete and the systems are returned to service.

We anticipate maintenance to be completed by the scheduled time. However, occasionally the maintenance may be completed earlier than scheduled or could be extended to the following days. A notification will be sent to the user mailing list when the systems are returned to service or the maintenance window is extended. Additionally, users will encounter the cluster service information upon logging in to Wulver during maintenance. Please pay attention to the Message of the Day when logging in, as it will serve as a reminder for upcoming downtimes or other crucial cluster-related information. Users should take into account the maintenance window when scheduling jobs and developing plans to meet various deadlines. Please do not contact the help desk, HPC staff or open SNOW tickets for access to the cluster or data during the maintenance downtime.
