# Office Hours for 2026 Spring

For this spring, we offer drop-in office hours every Monday and Wednesday from 2:00–4:00 p.m. Stop by to meet with our student consultants and ask any questions you have about using HPC resources. Whether you’re just getting started or need help with a specific issue, feel free to bring your laptop to walk us through any problems you're facing. There's no need to create a ticket in advance; if follow-up is needed, the student consultants will open a ticket on your behalf, and you'll receive further instructions.
