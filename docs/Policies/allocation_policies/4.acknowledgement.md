# Acknowledgement and Reporting

## Acknowledgement

All users should acknowledge NJIT ARCS in papers, posters, presentations and other published documents. Suggested text

```Portions of this work was performed on High Performance Computing resources provided by the Advanced Research Computing Services team at NJIT```

## Reporting Requirements

Recipients of all allocations (Annual and Research) are required to submit an annual progress report detailing their resource usage and research progress. These reports are crucial for monitoring cluster utilization, ensuring responsible use, and informing future allocation decisions.

### Timing
Reports are due within 3 months of the start of the new fiscal year. Failure to submit a report will jeopardize future automatic renewals (Startup) or delay the processing of new proposals (Research).

### PI Responsibilities in the Progress Report (Focus for Renewals)
To be considered a good steward of HPC resources, the PI must address the following points in their report:

* **SU Utilization Rate:** Provide the percentage of the total awarded SUs that were used.
* **Job Performance Metrics:** Summarize the average job size, average run time, and **Job Efficiency** (e.g., scaling achieved in production runs), demonstrating the efficient use of parallel resources.
* **Computational Progress:** Briefly summarize the computational milestones completed using the SUs, referencing the original plan.
* **Key Findings and Deliverables:** List the scientific/engineering findings, publications, presentations, or **external grant proposals** submitted/awarded that were enabled by the allocated time.
* **Data Management:** Detail the final data storage status and the plan for archiving/removing large data volumes from the cluster's shared directories.
* **Rationale for Renewal:** A clear statement linking the progress made to the remaining work required for a new allocation request (for Research proposals).
