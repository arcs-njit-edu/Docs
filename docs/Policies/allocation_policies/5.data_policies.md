# Data policies and HPC software

## Data Policies
All users must adhere to the university's data storage, security, and sharing policies. This includes implementing appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data and complying with regulations governing data privacy and confidentiality.

## Software Compatibility
The HPC cluster supports a range of commonly used scientific software packages. Users are encouraged to utilize these supported software to ensure compatibility and minimize technical support requirements. The HPC team does not purchase or procure software. It is the responsibility of the faculty requesting the allocations to purchase or procure software. The HPC team can assist with installing the software. Check out the [Software](../../Software/index.md) section for instructions on how to request software installation and to view the list of software packages already available on Wulver.
