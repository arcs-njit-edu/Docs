# Allocation Policies

## Introduction

This page outlines the policy and guidelines for requesting and obtaining allocations of computing time on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). The goal is to ensure fair, transparent, and efficient access to this valuable resource while supporting high-quality research at the university

## Eligibility

The HPC cluster is primarily intended for research conducted by NJIT faculty, and their collaborators. Any NJIT Tenure/Tenure Track Faculty member can serve as a PI on a research or education allocation. Adjunct and Visiting Faculty members are not eligible for research allocations. Any instructor - Lecturer, Adjunct or Visiting Faculty can serve as a PI on an education allocation in the term that the course will be offered. Emeritus faculty can serve as a PI provided they are actively supervising students who need access to the cluster or are teaching a registrar scheduled course.

## Proposal Deadlines
The Research Computing Advisory Board (RCAB) will review and award allocation proposals exceeding the annual 300K SUs up to 4 times a year. A call for proposal will be issued to the HPC PIs mailing list. The table below shows the submission deadline and award start for the four terms.
